# Base-Converter
It's a project made by a team of two people for the Computer Systems Arhitecture subject. My part of the project was more the application interface and my colleague worked more on the code for the conversion mechanism.
The application works with very large real numbers, the decimal precision being a maximum of 19 digits.
